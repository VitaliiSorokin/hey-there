2. Create a test application
3. The application should: display the text "Hey there" in the middle of the screen and after tapping anywhere on the screen a background color should be changed to a random color. You can also add any other feature to the app - that adds bonus points
4. Please do not use any external libraries for color generation
5. Push code to a GitHub
6. Send the link to a GitHub repository back

# Result

Application displays text "Hey there" in the center of the screen. Background color is generated randomly. If tap anywhere on the screen - background color will be changed to another randomly generated color. Color transition is performed with implicit animation and text animation as well.
